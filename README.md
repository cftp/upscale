# Upscale

Provides a minimum height and width for images and upscales uploaded images that are too small.

By default this will be 500x500 pixels, but this can be changed using the filters `cftp_upscale_minimum_width` and `cftp_upscale_minimum_height`.

This plugin requires the Image Magick PHP extension
